# GetRandomUser App

https://random-user-app-akt.netlify.app/

## Description 🟢

Hello! With this application, I learned to retrieve user data from an API address by clicking a button. I also added the option to add a user to a table created on the screen by clicking on the add user button. A simple but fun application :)

## Outcome 🎥

## Project Planning & Management 🗺️

**Epic User Story:** Retrieve and Store User Information

## **User Stories:**

1️-) **Retrieve User Information:**
-  (Fetch User Information via Axios) - Send a GET request to the chosen free and open source API using Axios. - Handle the response to extract usable user information. - Display the retrieved user information to the user.
-  (Manually Input User Information) - Create a user interface (form or input fields) for manual user data input. - Implement validation to ensure correctness and completeness of the entered information. - Save the manually inputted user data for storage.

2-) **Store User Information**
-  (Display Stored User Information) - Design a user-friendly table or list view to display both fetched and manually inputted user data. - Organize the displayed information in a clear and understandable format.
-  (Edit User Information) - Develop functionality to allow users to edit stored user data. - Design an intuitive interface for users to make edits to the displayed user information. - Update the database with the edited user data.
-  (Delete User Information) - Enable users to delete stored user data. - Implement a confirmation mechanism to prevent accidental deletions. - Remove the selected user data from the database upon user confirmation.
